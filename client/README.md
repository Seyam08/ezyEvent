# Project Repository Restructure

## Notice

We have restructured our project repositories to enhance maintainability and scalability. Previously, the **client** and **server** codebases were maintained in a single repository. To improve organization, we have split them into two separate repositories:

1. **Client Repository**
2. **Server Repository**

### **New Repositories**

- **Client Repository:** [Insert Client Repo URL]
- **Server Repository:** [Insert Server Repo URL]

### **Why the Change?**

- Improved maintainability by separating client and server code.
- Simplified collaboration for frontend and backend teams.
- Independent versioning and deployment for the client and server.

If you have any questions or need assistance with the new structure, please reach out to the team.

Thank you for adapting to this improved workflow!
