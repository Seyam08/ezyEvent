# ezyEvent - Event Management System

**ezyEvent** is a full-stack event platform with a React.js/Vite frontend and Node.js/Express backend. The frontend uses RTK Query for API calls and JWT authentication, organized by features for scalability. The backend offers a RESTful API with MongoDB, handling CRUD operations for events/users with secure JWT/bcrypt auth. Following monorepo architecture, it cleanly separates client and server code while enabling seamless communication via REST standards.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

### Frontend (Client)

- Built with **React.js + Vite**
- Uses **RTK Query** for API communication
- Protected routes with JWT authentication
- Feature-based architecture

### Backend (Server)

- RESTful API with **Node.js/Express**
- MongoDB database
- JWT authentication
- CRUD operations for events/users

## ðŸ”Œ API Connection

The frontend communicates with backend via:

- All requests require valid JWT (except login/register)
- Standard REST conventions (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
